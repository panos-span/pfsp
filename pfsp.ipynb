    "# Permutation Flowshop Scheduling Problem (PFSP)\n",

    "The Permutation Flowshop Scheduling Problem (PFSP) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem. The problem is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    " Given a set of jobs $J = \\{J_1, J_2, \\ldots, J_n\\}$ and a set of machines $M = \\{M_1, M_2, \\ldots, M_m\\}$, where each job $J_i$ consists of $m$ operations, one for each machine, the objective is to find a permutation of the jobs that minimizes the makespan, i.e., the total time it takes to process all jobs on all machines.\n",

    "The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic inspired by Charles Darwin's theory of natural evolution. It reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction to produce offspring of the next generation. The algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions. At each step, the GA selects individuals at random from the current population to be parents and uses them to produce the children for the next generation. Over successive generations, the population \"evolves\" toward an optimal solution.\n",

    "\n",
    "1) **Initialization**: Start with a randomly generated population of nn chromosomes (possible solutions for the problem).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3) **Selection**: Select parent chromosomes for breeding. Parents are selected according to their fitness. The better the chromosomes are, the more chances they have to be selected for reproduction. This step mimics the \"survival of the fittest\" principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Crossover** (Recombination): Combine the genetic information of two parents to generate new offspring. There are various methods to perform crossover such as single-point crossover, multi-point crossover, and uniform crossover.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) **Mutation**: Apply random mutations to some offspring at some probability. This step introduces genetic diversity into the population, providing new genetic structures to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) **Replacement**: Form a new population by selecting individuals from the current population and the offspring. This new generation is then used in the next iteration of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) **Termination**: Repeat the steps from Fitness Calculation to Replacement until a termination condition is met (e.g., a maximum number of generations is reached, or a satisfactory fitness level has been achieved)."

We have defined the objective function for the PFSP, implemented the Genetic Algorithm with selection, crossover, and mutation operators, and integrated Tabu Search to improve the performance of the Genetic Algorithm. We have also performed hyperparameter optimization using Optuna to find the best set of hyperparameters for the Genetic Algorithm with Tabu Search.\n",
