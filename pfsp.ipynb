    " Given a set of jobs $J = \\{J_1, J_2, \\ldots, J_n\\}$ and a set of machines $M = \\{M_1, M_2, \\ldots, M_m\\}$, where each job $J_i$ consists of $m$ operations, one for each machine, the objective is to find a permutation of the jobs that minimizes the makespan, i.e., the total time it takes to process all jobs on all machines.\n",

    "In order to solve the Ta001 problem, we will use the Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic inspired by Charles Darwin's theory of natural evolution. It reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction to produce offspring of the next generation. The algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions. At each step, the GA selects individuals at random from the current population to be parents and uses them to produce the children for the next generation. Over successive generations, the population \"evolves\" toward an optimal solution.\n",
    "How the Genetic Algorithm works : \n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Initialization**: Start with a randomly generated population of nn chromosomes (possible solutions for the problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Fitness Calculation**: Evaluate the fitness f(x)f(x) of each chromosome xx in the population. The fitness score is an indication of how good a solution is relative to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Selection**: Select parent chromosomes for breeding. Parents are selected according to their fitness. The better the chromosomes are, the more chances they have to be selected for reproduction. This step mimics the \"survival of the fittest\" principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Crossover** (Recombination): Combine the genetic information of two parents to generate new offspring. There are various methods to perform crossover such as single-point crossover, multi-point crossover, and uniform crossover.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) **Mutation**: Apply random mutations to some offspring at some probability. This step introduces genetic diversity into the population, providing new genetic structures to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) **Replacement**: Form a new population by selecting individuals from the current population and the offspring. This new generation is then used in the next iteration of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) **Termination**: Repeat the steps from Fitness Calculation to Replacement until a termination condition is met (e.g., a maximum number of generations is reached, or a satisfactory fitness level has been achieved)."

    "**Tabu Search**, developed by Fred Glover in 1986, is particularly known for its ability to escape local optima, a common challenge in optimization problems. It achieves this by maintaining a tabu list—a short-term memory of recently visited solutions (or moves that alter the current solution) that are temporarily banned or made \"tabu.\" This prevents the search from cycling back to previously explored solutions, encouraging exploration of new regions of the solution space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key components of Tabu Search include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tabu List**: A list that records certain attributes of the recently visited solutions (or the moves made) to prevent the algorithm from revisiting them. The list has a fixed length (tenure), after which the oldest entries are removed to make room for new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Aspiration Criteria**: Conditions under which the tabu status of a solution (or move) can be overridden. Typically, if a move leads to a solution better than any seen so far (even if the move is tabu), it may be accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Neighborhood Search**: At each iteration, Tabu Search examines the \"neighborhood\" of the current solution (solutions reachable from the current solution through a single move) and moves to the best solution in this neighborhood that is not tabu (unless overridden by the aspiration criteria).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Diversification and Intensification Strategies**: Mechanisms to explore the solution space broadly (diversification) and to exploit promising regions of the solution space deeply (intensification)."

    "In this notebook, we have implemented a hybrid Genetic Algorithm with Tabu Search to solve the Permutation Flowshop Scheduling Problem (PFSP). We have defined the objective function for the PFSP, implemented the Genetic Algorithm with selection, crossover, and mutation operators, and integrated Tabu Search to improve the performance of the Genetic Algorithm. We have also performed hyperparameter optimization using Optuna to find the best set of hyperparameters for the Genetic Algorithm with Tabu Search.\n",

The hyperparameter optimization process using Optuna helped us find the best set of hyperparameters that minimized the time taken to find the optimal solution."
